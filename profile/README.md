# SpongeAss

We are a small group of developers from the SpongeAss discord with a range of experience, skills, and interests.

Our current flagship repository is [Pathways](https://github.com/spongedsc/pathways), a multi-modal AI discord bot built for the SpongeAss discord server.

We are always open for new members to join our team, so if you are interested in contributing to our project(s), feel free to join the discord server and introduce yourself!
